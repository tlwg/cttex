Changes:
========
	New features in version 1.19 and beyond are described in
README.th

Description:
============
	The main part of Cttex is A Thai Word Separator algorithm using
a dictionary. A wrapper for formatting Thai LaTeX document file is provided
to demonstrate the use of this word-sep routine. The program can also
be used as a simple word-sep filter.

Contents:
=========
	cttex.c		The word-sep routine & LaTeX wrapper
	dictsort.c	Sort contents of dictionary file
	tdict.txt	Dict file
	dict2c.pl	Perl script to convert tdict.txt -> tdict.h

Usage:
======
	cttex [cutcode] < infile > outfile

	'cutcode' specifies the ASCII code of character to be inserted
in filter mode.

Examples

	- LaTeX mode 

		cttex < foo.ttex > foo.tex

	- Filter mode

		cttex 32 < infile > outfile

	Here, the blank (ascii 32) is inserted at every breakable
	point.

Build:
======
	Just type 'make'

Note:
=====
	If you only need the word-sep routine, remove everyting
in main() but the line
	
	cutcode = CUTCODE;

This line defines what character to be inserted at word-breakable
points. The main word-sep routine is dooneline().

Let me know if you find any bugs or have any comment.

Thank you.
